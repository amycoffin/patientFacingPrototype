# What is a Variant of Unknown Significance \(VUS\)?

When a variant is classified as a Variant of Uncertain Significance \(VUS\), this means that the evidence of disease risk is not clear yet, sometimes because there is not yet enough evidence to classify them as either pathogenic or benign. These types of variants are being continually assessed by the research community, and efforts are being made to learn more about them. Ultimately, scientists are looking to classify VUSs as pathogenic, likely pathogenic, benign, or likely benign. This process does not necessarily have a set time span. Determining the clinical significance of a VUS is contingent upon what knowledge emerges about that variant, making it hard to know when a variant might be reliably interpreted.

\[reason for above blurb: if someone is told their interpretation is uncertain, their next question might be "well when will they find out?" This is information that might not be available in other literature, that we might be able to explain best\]
