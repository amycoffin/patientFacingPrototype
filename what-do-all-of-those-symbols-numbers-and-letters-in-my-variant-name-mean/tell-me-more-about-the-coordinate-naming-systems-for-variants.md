The easiest variant names to decode are the &lt;substitution variants&gt;, also known as a point mutations or single nucleotide variants \(SNVs\). Most basically, they are a kind of variant “substitution of one base pair for another” \(Alberts 218\). When a gene contains a substitution variant, there might be a ‘misspelling’ in its instructions that only includes one letter being replaced with another. A substitution variant’s name tells us which sequence reference \(genome-based, gene-based, or protein-based\) is being used to describe the substitution variant, where the variant is in the sequence, and what single nucleotide change occurred at that location.

Let’s get back to BRCA2, and the variant 'chr13:g.32338271:G&gt;A'. Chromosome 13, where BRCA2 is found, is made up of about 115 million base pairs \([https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/chromosome/13\\](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/chromosome/13\\)\). Recall that {chromosomes are inherited by your parents} and carry your genes, which have slight differences, or variants, that make you unique.

So, the first question to ask when looking at a variant is “Which sequence-reference is being used?” The answer lies in the first few letters. In this case, the variant is referencing chromosomal DNA \(the g.enome\):

The genome-based reference is like having a GPS mapping of a whole state: just like a map of California includes all of its cities, the genome-based reference includes all of a chromosome’s genes and nucleotides. In order to map Chromosome 13’s nucleotides, each one is numbered 1-115,000,000. Numbering the nucleotides keeps track of where the variant is. To use a simple example, let’s pretend Chromosome 1 is only 8 nucleotides long, and that its digital sequence is provided below. We can refer to the first T in the sequence using variant nomenclature, noting that the first T is at position 2, perhaps using a name like “chr1:g.2”.

The next step in decoding the 'chr13:g.32338271:G&gt;A' variant is using the number following the “g.” to answer “Where does the variant occur in the sequence?”. In this case, the variant has a change at the 32,338,271th position on chromosome 13, as given by its genomic number or 'coordinate':
