The process of determining the clinical significance of a variant is a little bit different, depending on testing companies. However, the basic steps are as follows:

1. Obtain your DNA
2. Sequence your genome
3. Determine what variants you have in the BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 genes
4. Use statistics to find what risk is associated with your variants

BRCA Exchange, which collects information on BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 variants from as many sources as possible, relies on something called the {ENGIMA BRCA 1/2 Classification Criteria}. This is an expertly crafted way for assessments to be made about BRCA variants.
