Similarly, if you were told by your testing company that “no clinically significant mutation was identified,” you might have a benign variant whose name is not provided on the report \(?\). Benign variants might also be listed with a specific name, and a result of “no mutation detected.” Any of these results mean that according to what is known about this variant, having this ‘misspelled’ version of a BRCA-1 or BRCA-2 gene does not make you more likely of getting disease than someone with a normal BRCA-1 or BRCA-2 gene.
