# Your Genes Code for Proteins

To review, whole chromosomes are sequenced to obtain their unique “spellings,” and a region of a chromosome is considered a genes. Genes instruct cells how to make **proteins**, which ultimately do most of the work associated with a gene. This process involves translating a string of nucleotides \(DNA\) into a string of **amino acids, **thus making a **protein**. Similar to DNA, which is made of nucleotide building blocks, proteins are made of amino acid building blocks. However, your cells have to keep genes safe, because each cell only has one full set of gene instructions. Thus, the cell goes through a few different steps to read genes and make them into proteins without compromising the original copy.

A metaphor might be the best way to explain these steps:

> Think of a chromosome as a kind of overly detailed instruction manual. Let’s say that you have a manual that contains information on how to build a bookcase that you ordered online. You want to use this manual to build your bookcase, but it also contains extraneous manufacturing information, such as history of all bookcases, instructions for other furniture, and instructions for taking apart bookcases. Upon skimming this manual’s table of contents, you see that the bookcase section is between pages 64 and 70.

> Instead of using the whole book to build your book case, you only end up using pages 64-70 to build your bookcase.

This bookcase-building process is analogous to what your cells do. Consider a chromosome, like chromosome 13, to be a kind of manual: a lot of information is contained in the chromosome, but only one specific region is needed to make a BRCA2 protein. BRCA2 is in between nucleotide number 32,315,480 and 32,399,672 in chromosome 13 according to the reference genome, which is analogous to instructions being in pages 64-70 in the instruction manual \([Genetics Home Reference](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/BRCA2#location)\). The cell makes a copy of this region, using **mRNA**. The mRNA then travels to the **ribosome**, which follows the instructions and builds a protein. A protein is built using **amino acids**, which are small molecules that can be arranged in different orders, depending on what protein the gene is giving instructions for.
