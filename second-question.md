## What biological role do BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 genes have in cancer risk?

> “BRCA1 and BRCA2 are human genes that produce tumor suppressor proteins. These proteins help repair damaged DNA and, therefore, play a role in ensuring the stability of the cell’s genetic material. When either of these genes is mutated, or altered, such that its protein product either is not made or does not function correctly, DNA damage may not be repaired properly. As a result, cells are more likely to develop additional genetic alterations that can lead to cancer.” \([BRCA Fact Sheet](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/genetics/brca-fact-sheet)\)

-Write about central dogma to focus on BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 and Tumor Suppressor Proteins

* im confused about TSPs fixing broken DNA vs. helping control cell growth. If the mechanism is broken, thus not checking for DNA damage, then the cell cycle might also be affected because S phase is affected… 

-Perhaps use this quote as a jumping off point, and then just bring back some of the spelling metaphors, expand a bit on same points paragraph makes but using variant language.

-trash the photocopy metaphor, leave that for sequencing
