For the purposes of BRCA Exchange, “deleterious,” “pathogenic”, and “clinically significant,” can be thought of as simply “pathogenic” or “likely pathogenic.” Pathogenic variants increase your risk of disease; if you have a likely pathogenic variant, there is good evidence that shows you are at increased risk of hereditary disease. In other words, pathogenicity in a BRCA variant means that you have higher chance of BRCA-related disease than someone with no variants in the BRCA genes.
