# What is a pathogenic variant?

When a variant is classified as _pathogenic_, scientists have determined that people with that variant have an increased risk of disease. Similarly, a _likely pathogenic_ variant is one which there is good, but not quite definitive, evidence that the variant is associated with disease risk. Even if you have an existing cancer diagnosis, these results can provide insight about inherited risk factors, which can inform treatment options. Because genetic tests are useful for a wide variety of reasons, results should be interpreted by genetic counselors and other healthcare professionals.

Although BRCA Exchange aggregates knowledge about BRCA variants, this site is not intended to provide a clinical diagnosis or medical advice. Please contact your primary care provider to determine what steps may be necessary after receiving a genetic test result.
