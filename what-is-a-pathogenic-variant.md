For the purposes of BRCA Exchange, “deleterious,” “pathogenic”, and “clinically significant,” can be thought of as simply “pathogenic” or “likely pathogenic.” Pathogenic variants increase your risk of disease; if you have a likely pathogenic variant, there is good evidence that shows you are at increased risk of hereditary disease. In other words, pathogenicity in a BRCA variant means that you have higher chance of BRCA-related disease than someone with no variants in their BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 genes.

While BRCA Exchange does aggregate knowledge about BRCA variants, this site is not intended to provide a clinical diagnosis or medical advice. Please contact your primary care provider to determine what steps may be necessary after receiving a genetic test result.
