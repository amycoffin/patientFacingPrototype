## Why does my family history matter to my risk of hereditary cancer?

&lt;Genes&gt; contain instructions for &lt;proteins&gt;, which make up the machinery of your cells and body. They do everything from causing embryo development, to keeping an adult body functioning properly. \[should we allude to tumor supressor proteins?\] These genes are found on &lt;chromosomes&gt;, which you inherit from your parents.

Because variants are found in our genes, which are passed down from our parents via chromosomes, we also inherit &lt;variants&gt;. Looking at your family history of breast, ovarian, or other BRCA-related cancers can indicate that there might be a &lt;pathogenic variant&gt;, or a variant that increases your risk of cancer, which has been inherited by members of your family. Even if your parent has a pathogenic variant that caused cancer, there is no guarantee that you inherited it. A genetic test can check for variants carried in your family, as well as determining what what variants you have compared to the rest of the population. Family histories can also help contribute information about a variant that might not be well understood by scientists.
