## How do I search for my variant on BRCA Exchange?

Searching for your variant on BRCA Exchange can allow you to obtain up-to-date, expert interpretations for the variant found by your genetic test. \[NEED SOME STATS ABOUT CHANGES\]. When you arrive at brcaexchange.org, you are prompted with a &lt;search box&gt;. This search box does not search the entire website, but instead, provides direct access to the BRCA Exchange Expert Reviewed database:

Unlike ClinVar and other variant databases you might have seen before, BRCAExchange only contains BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 variants. You can type in the variant name directly from your genetic test result. This name can look a number of different ways \[\[LIST\]\], but usually takes the form of letter-number-letter, or some combination of letters and numbers strung together. You can type this name, such as c.3916G&gt;A, into the search box, click the magnifying glass, and find the database entry:

If you are just looking to confirm your test result, get updated knowledge about your variant, you can simply look under the “Clinical Significance” Tile, and note what is listed under “Clinical Significance” or “IARC Class”:
